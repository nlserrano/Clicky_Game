Created using React, this is a memory game featuring characters from the video game franchise Metal Gear Solid! In this application, the UI is broken down into components, manages component state, and responds to user events.

## How to Play:
- Try to select all 12 images only once to win.
- Be careful, images will shuffle around everytime an image is clicked!
- If you click on a previously clicked image, you lose and will have to start all over!
